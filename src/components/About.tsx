            Gorham United is a group of Gorham residents committed to promoting
            responsible development and amplifying residents&rsquo; voices in
            town government. We organized a public meeting on February 26, 2026
            to share clear, factual information about major development proposals, hear
            from residents, and answer questions. We are focused on transparency,
            process, and long-term fit for Gorham.
